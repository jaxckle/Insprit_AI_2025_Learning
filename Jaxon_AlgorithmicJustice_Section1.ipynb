        "In this series of notebooks, we'll be exploring the intersections of ethics and AI. We'll be using the **COMPAS** dataset, a dataset of arrest records with demographic, prior conviction, and other information.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll assume basic familiarity with Python, basic machine learning concepts, as well as (very) basic knowledge of Pandas (a useful DataFrame processing/data analysis tool). As you go through this notebook, please feel free to add cells for your exploration; however, do keep all the original cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will cover these general topics:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Building a competitive model on the COMPAS dataset.\n",
        "2. Analyzing bias and fairness on the COMPAS dataset.\n",
        "3. Exploring and justifying fair models on the COMPAS dataset; discussing fairness in machine learning beyond COMPAS.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Learning Goals**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Review basic mathematical concepts relevant to training a machine learning model.\n",
        "* Review how model iteration works in machine learning.\n",
        "* Explore and develop a machine learning model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Background: What is COMPAS?**\n",
        "\n",
        "COMPAS, which stands for Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions, is an algorithmic risk-assessment tool that attempts to predict whether a defendant is likely to reoffend (recidivate). This tool is specifically intended to be used in the pre-trial detention phase, in which bail determinations are made. Ideally, based on particular characteristics about a defendant, the model would predict whether or not someone is likely to commit another crime if released. This software has been used in many U.S. jurisdictions, including New York, Wisconsin, California, and Broward County, FL.\n",
        "\n",
        "Racial tensions and specificaly anti-Blackness has existed in the U.S. for centuries. In the modern day, racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system is a particularly difficult sociological problem. The idea was that a machine learning model would be able to be \"less biased\" than a human judge, and therefore provide better outcomes for all people. However, the adoption of COMPAS has not been without controversy, and has been challenged on legal and ethical grounds perhaps most prominently in the Wisconsin State Supreme Court case *Loomis v. Wisconsin (2012)*. In Loomis v. Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the use of COMPAS in sentencing, despite concerns about its lack of transparency and potential racial bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "As instructors, we understand that given current events, this is an extremely sensitive topic. The topics in this notebook unfortunately continue to be salient today, and are precisely the conditions of injustice that directly result in datasets like COMPAS. We all come from different backgrounds, so please be respectful of your peers and consider the impact your words have on our classroom community. For those of you who would like to learn more about racial bias in the U.S. and the current state of affairs, please explore [this Atlantic article](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/american-nightmare/612457/). Do note that it covers some difficult topics that may be difficult to process or read for some individuals. We ask you again to be mindful and respectful. Please do not hesitate to reach out to the teaching team if you would like any support.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our dataset is specifically from the Broward County, FL public records, which ProPublica was able to obtain and make public through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Let's take a look at the data."
